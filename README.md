# Discord-High-Priority
Batch script to set discord on high priority on doubleclick. Helps slower connections and computers prevent voicechat lag and discord crashes.

## How to Use

1) To set up, right click the bath file after downloading and choose "edit". Change $USER_HERE to your windows username. 

2) Go to C:\Users\$USER_HERE\AppData\Local\Discord and check the app version. If it's been updated (C:\Users\camil\AppData\Local\Discord\app-0.0.306 to, for example, a newer update app-0.0.307), make sure to update the path to match that. Save all changes and close.

3) Done! Just right click the batch file whenever you need and it'll automatically set Discord to high priority.


## Important!

Make sure to keep the app version updated whenever Discord gets an update!
